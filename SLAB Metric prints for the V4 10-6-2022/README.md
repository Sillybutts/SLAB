(Make sure you are looking at the Metric google sheet tab. Tabs are at the bottom of the page.)
# THESE FILES AND HARDWARE ARE EXPERIMENTAL. THEY ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE, AND SLIGHTLY BEHIND THE IMPERIAL SPEC V4 SLAB IN TERMS OF UPDATED FEATURES. (These metric files are from October 2022.)
## CURRENTLY, THE MAGWELL AND TURNAROUND ARE SLIGHTLY FRAGILE. THIS WILL BE FIXED IN A FUTURE UPDATE. WHEN THIS TEXT IS NO LONGER ON THE PAGE, IT IS FIXED.


## These prints replace SOME of the normal SLAB v4 parts. The rest of the SLAB v4 parts require NO MODIFICATION.
