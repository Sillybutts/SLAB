Super glue is also needed to keep the plunger tube attached. Using an elastic hair tie instead of elastic cord for the catch is recommended for aesthetics, but not needed. 

The blaster is designed for 4 inches of k25 with a 12 inch barrel. The barrel can be longer or shorter, and you can fit springs anywhere from 4 inches to 6 inches in the blaster. It works with 788, k25, k26, and probably k14.
