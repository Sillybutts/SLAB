## Description

General blaster overview: https://youtu.be/oZG_x506SXU

The SLAB is a lever action, Talon mag fed, half dart springer.

As with many of my other designs, the SLAB is an amalgamation of several design ideas from other blasters.
- SillyPistol plunger, catch, and top slide as handguard
- Lynx turnaround
- Vikinger custom FLAK stock
- FLAK lever & trigger
- Chimera mk7 trigger linkage
- Medusa magwell-to-lever connection (previously done by the FLAK)
- Skewer magwell
- Caliburn and Talon Claw priming bars used as reinforcement

For sights, I recommend you use some picatinny iron sights or a red dot sight. Some good picatinny sights:
- https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2376150/files FrontPip and Pip in the Caliburn fileset are great iron sights.

- https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2829229
- https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5103083
I will eventually make my own iron sights for this blaster.

### Hardware notes:

- Super glue is also needed to keep the plunger tube attached. Using an elastic hair tie instead of elastic cord for the catch is recommended for aesthetics, but not needed. 
- The blaster is designed for 4 inches of k25 with a 12 inch barrel. The barrel can be longer or shorter, and you can fit springs anywhere from 4 inches to 6 inches in the blaster. It works with 788, k25, k26, and probably k14.
- The Lynx thumb screw and nut aren't 100% needed. 
- A long (2 inch) takedown pin can be cut down to the medium and short takedown pin sizes.
- Small cotter pins to keep the takedown pins in place are nice to have, but you could use filament or twisted wire or whatever instead.
