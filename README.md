<summary>Thanks to my beta testers who contributed a bunch of features and variant parts to the SLAB! Here's a list of who did what: (click this text)</summary>

- Baygull made the first version of the Handguard wBackstop
- Baygull contributed the little pointy bits to the top rail that align it with the MuzzleB and TopCover
- Ehdrien contributed his fancy printed cotter pins
- Ehdrien made the first chopped Talon magwell by literally chopping the standard one at an angle in his slicer
- The nice handwriting on the SLAB logo is from Jessie (Silverfox), thanks for letting me add that to the blaster :)

Also, thanks to all my beta testers for their feedback while designing the SLAB. Couldn't have done it (this well) without you guys(and gals)!

- Ehdrien
- BansheeIndian
- BoomstickMods
- Junior7
- SilverFox (Jessie and Ryan)

<summary> As with many of my other designs, the SLAB is an amalgamation of several design ideas from other blasters. Here's a nice list: (click this text)</summary>

- SillyPistol derived plunger, catch, and top slide as handguard (heavily modified)
- Lynx derived turnaround (heavily modified)
- Vikinger custom FLAK stock & lever (heavily modified)
- FLAK derived trigger & lever (heavily modified)
- Chimera mk7 trigger linkage (inspired)
- Medusa magwell-to-lever connection (inspired, previously done by FLAK)
- Skewer derived magwell (heavily modified)
- Caliburn and Talon Claw priming bars used as reinforcement

The blaster comes with front and rear iron sights in the White STL folder. The holes in them are sized for 1.75mm filament. They are held in place by two 4-40 screws per sight.

Here are some good alternate Picatinny sights if you want something other than mine:

## Hardware, Compatability, and Availability

<img src="GHimages/T4%20OR%20V3%20BAR%20GUIDE.png" width="500">
<details>
<summary>If you have a V3 kit instead of a release v4 kit, please click this text for some V3 BETA KIT info. All other info on this page is for the V4 or current release of the SLAB.</summary>
  
The v3 bar BETA hardware can be converted to a release v4 hardware kit by swapping the TCv3 and Caliburn v3 bars to TC T4 and Caliburn C4 bars, adding 3x 10-32 short screws (the ones used to hold the foregrip on Talon Claws and Caliburns), and adding some more o-rings.

  v3 BAR BETA VERSION Changelog

- Changelog: 6-17-22: Updated the Turnaround to better support the barrel
- Changelog: 6-19-22: Updated the Rail and Handguard wPicatinny to have nicer picatinny. Requires supports. Updated bottlenose and bottlenose wSling parts to be thicker walled.
- Changelog: 6-20-22: Updated the Rail to be split in half for easier printing (RailA, RailB). Updated the Magwell and Turnaround to add a new part, FeedGuide. This makes the whole assembly sturdier and easier to print.
- Changelog: 6-21-22: Apparently the Handguard, Handguard wPicatinny, MuzzleA, MuzzleB, and the TC length MuzzleB had misaligned screw holes. No idea where that got borked in the cad process lol. Fixed the holes, and made the Handguards slightly thicker and easier to print.
- Changelog: 6-22-22: Updated the TopCover's back tab to fit into the reciever notches easier. Updated the side covers to have slightly more pin clearance. 
- Changelog: 6-30-22: Apparently the wrong Magwell part was uploaded. The new part has a separate feed lip portion. Do not print the magwell with integrated feed lips.
- Changelog: 7-3-22: Fixed screw head relief spacing in the side cover parts that had become misaligned between the first and second prototype SLAB prints.
- Changelog: 7-9-22: Added new Bottlenose parts with cutouts for SCAR clearance. Added some iron sights for the picatinny rail, with holes to jam filament into for extra snazziness. Edited the Turnaround to hold the barrel centered better. Added a shim/spacer for the picatinny rail, if you have a gap.
- Changelog: 7-20-22: Lots of changes! New muzzle with better barrel centering. New turnaround that prints nicer and lets you glue/screw the PT on easier, and put in the thumb screw nut easier. New lever variants. New ram for double o-rings. Priming Bars print nicer now. Pin caps added. Updated the trigger linkage bits to not loosen over time. Better Bottlenose parts with more barrel clearance. Longshot spring compatibility.
- Changelog: 7-22-22: Updated TriggerBlock to have a looser pivot hole.
- Changelog: 7-23-22: Tweaked the CatchPusher's rod hole to be slightly shallower, hopefully improving trigger feel.
- Changelog: 7-24-22: Removed the PinCap part, replaced with PrintedCotterPin from Ehdrien. They work a LOT better!

### Hardware notes:

- Super glue or epoxy (or plumbers Goop, or hot glue or silicone or some other adhesive) is used to keep the plunger tube attached to the TurnaroundCap. MAKE SURE TO FOLLOW THE ASSEMBLY STEPS CORRECTLY WHEN ASSEMBLING THE PLUNGER AND TURNAROUND.
- Using an elastic hair tie instead of elastic cord for the catch is recommended for aesthetics, but not needed. 
- The blaster is designed for 4 inches of k25 with a 12 inch barrel. The barrel can be longer or shorter, and you can fit springs anywhere from 4 inches to 6 inches in the blaster. The blaster also fits Longshot springs, but be careful with using super strong springs. The blaster is meant to use 788 and k25. It can fit k26 and k14, but those springs WILL cause durability issues for minimal meaningful performance gains.
- Use the PrintedCotterPins to keep the two long takedown pins in place (the ones through the turnaround and the lever).
- There are two very small pins. The slightly longer one is for the mag release, the slightly shorter one is for the trigger.
- Put the -123 o-ring, the two 016 o-rings, and the nut/thumb screw into the turnaround BEFORE attaching the plunger tube.
- When using the split turnaround, put an 016 o-ring between the two parts, screw them together, then glue on the plunger tube.

## Printing Info

All STLs were exported in print orientation. F3D & STEP source files are also provided.

The GripPanel L/R parts need supports.

The RailA/B, Ram, RodCap, RodCapPivot, RodCapKeeper, and PrintedCotterPin parts require brims.

This blaster is designed for PLA parts. Printing in other filaments (like PETG) should be fine, but might lead to broken parts.

Infills:
- Black: 
- - PlungerRod 100% Gyroid, 5+ walls.
- - Everything else, 20% Gyroid, 5 walls. 
- - GripPanels need support.

- White: 
- - All at 20% Gyroid, 5 walls. 
- - Rails A/B need a brim and MUST be printed on the flat end.

- Orange: 
- - Muzzle attachments (Bottlenose, end caps, etc), Ram, RodCap, RodCapPivot, RodCapKeeper, PrintedCotterPin (x2), Catch, and CatchPusher 100% 5 walls. 
- - Everything else, 20% Gyroid, 5 walls. 
- - The Ram, RodCap, RodCapPivot, RodCapKeeper, and PrintedCotterPin (x2) parts require brims.
- - The optional Bottlenose parts need supports.

- Green: 
- - StockPanels and StockCores at 10% gyroid, 4 walls. 
- - PrimeTransferBar (x2), 100% Gyroid, 5 walls.
- - Everything else, 20% Gyroid, 5 walls. 
- - The SideCovers L/R with text should be printed with THE TEXT NOT TOUCHING THE BUILD PLATE, using supports. The ones WITHOUT TEXT can be printed with the FLAT SIDE ON THE BUILD PLATE. This is done to keep the text nice and crisp. Maybe do a filament change on the layer before the letters to make them really pop!

## Troubleshooting and common issues

First off, thank you to my beta testers for helping me iron out the kinks in the SLAB before release. That said, there are still some common issues that people have. Thankfully, they are solveable. Blaster launches never go 100% smoothly, so please be understanding with any issues you have, as the design is still very fresh and hasn't gone through years of tweaking. 

Here's a few common issues. If your issue isn't listed here, please message me (contact info at the bottom of this page).
